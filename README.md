# Software Engineering: MedBook
This repository contains the deliverables (pdf files) as well as some class diagramms (uml files) of the **MedBook** project.
This project, which was developed in the context of **Software Engineering I** course, involves brainstorming and designing the abstract features of an innovative software application.
The course's goal was to make us familiar with the agile development practices for modern software applications, and basic principles like user requirements, usecases, user stories and UI/UX design.
