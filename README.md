# Software Engineering: MedBook
This repository contains the deliverables (pdf files) as well as some class diagramms (uml files) of the **MedBook** project.
This project, which was developed in the context of **Software Engineering I** course, involves brainstorming and designing the abstract features of an innovative software application.     
The course's goal was to make us familiar with the agile development practices for modern software applications, and basic principles like user requirements, usecases, user stories and UI/UX design.
In addition, it includes also class diagramms following the BEC convention (Boundary-Entity-Controller). This project did not involve any coding, just abstract design.
    
## Our application: searching for a doctor made easy.
Our idea was to design an application in which registered patients can search for registered doctors and book appointments via Medbook's interface.
After the appointment, the patient can also upload a review on their experience, providing feedback about the doctor.    
This innovative application can aid in easy searching for the appropriate physician, bringing patients and doctors closer to each other. This can also help young doctors to establishing a good reputation among patients. The review system that we adopt can offer useful information about a doctor, their personality and their infirmary.
